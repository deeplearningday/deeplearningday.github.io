# About

It is impossible to overlook the transformative effect that the field of deep learning has had on the world and sciences. Deep neural networks have been growing omnipresent, thanks to their state-of-the-art performance in a number of domains (computer vision, speech recognition and generation, natural language understanding and translation, etc). Research and newest applications continue sprouting regularly, thus only widening the existing lead. The large swarm of new applications introduces new challenges, including the ones like data and compute efficiency, reliability, robustness and safety, ethical considerations and privacy constraints, and others. 

To reflect on the recent advancements of the deep learning field at KDD 2021, Deep Learning Day will focus on “Understanding Limits and Pushing the Boundaries of Deep Learning”, with topics including theoretical understanding, scaling deep learning, fairness and transparency, and testing and evaluation.

On behalf of the Deep Learning Day and KDD 2021 organizing committee, we welcome you all to attend this event!


<!-- #Call

We plan to solicit short paper submissions for “deep learning critique” from the community, which aims to better understand and to improve all stages of the research process in deep learning. Accepted papers will be given a 15-min slot for contributed talk on the DL day. We invite you to refer to an earlier effort to register trends and debates, analyze bad practices and inventorize open problems at “Critiquing and Correcting Trends in Machine Learning 2018” Workshop: https://ml-critique-correct.github.io/.
